## Problem Statement
This dashboard helps the company to understand their sales better and provides a comprehensive view of how data analysis projects are executed in large organizations. The case study focuses on a computer hardware business facing challenges in a dynamically changing market. I built a Tableau dashboard that offers real-time sales insights for the company.
In this project, I analyzed and transformed data, creating interactive visualizations, reports, and dashboards using Tableau Desktop. The sales data of a sample company was selected for analysis and visualization. The query editing was performed using MySQL server, while the visualization was done using Tableau Desktop. From the "sales" database, the following tables were chosen for analysis:- customers.sql
